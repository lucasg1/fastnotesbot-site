                <p>These terms explain how FastNotes Bot works, how billing is handled, and what we expect from you as a
                    customer.</p>

            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
            <p>FastNotes Bot is a software-as-a-service product that transcribes and summarizes audio conversations within
                Discord servers. By inviting or using the bot you agree to these Terms of Service.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
            <p>You must be at least 13 years old or meet the age requirements of your jurisdiction to use Discord. You are
                responsible for ensuring you have the right to upload or record content within your server.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Payment and Billing</h2>
            <p>FastNotes Bot is billed through Stripe on a recurring monthly basis. Charges apply to the Discord workspace
                associated with your subscription. Optional usage top-ups can be purchased at any time. You may cancel at
                any point, and access continues until the end of the billing period.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Fair Use</h2>
            <p>Subscriptions are intended for small to medium sized teams. Excessive or abnormal usage may result in temporary
                limits or a request to upgrade your plan so we can continue providing reliable service.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Privacy and Data</h2>
            <p>Transcripts and summaries are generated only for the channels where the bot is configured. We rely on secure
                infrastructure to process audio and retain the minimum information required to deliver the service. Review
                your Discord server policies to ensure participants know the recording policy.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Acceptable Use</h2>
            <p>Do not use FastNotes Bot to violate Discord's Terms of Service, infringe intellectual property rights, or
                engage in illegal activity. We reserve the right to suspend access if activity is harmful or abusive.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Service Availability</h2>
            <p>We aim for uninterrupted service, but downtime can occur. We may change or discontinue features with notice
                when possible. We are not liable for indirect damages such as lost profits or data.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of FastNotes Bot after changes take effect
                constitutes acceptance of the revised terms. Material changes will be communicated through Discord or email
                when available.</p>
        </section>
